# 🧠 HR Attrition Prediction 
## 📊 Data-Driven Insights for Smarter HR Decisions
### 🚀 Project Overview

The HR Attrition Prediction Dashboard is an end-to-end data analytics project designed to help organizations understand the key drivers of employee attrition and predict potential turnover risks.
Using a blend of data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling, this project empowers HR teams to retain top talent, reduce hiring costs, and build a more satisfied workforce.

By transforming raw HR data into clear insights through Power BI, SQL, and Python, this project bridges the gap between data science and human resource management.
### 🎯 Objectives

Identify factors that contribute most to employee attrition.

Build a data-driven attrition prediction system.

Visualize workforce demographics, job satisfaction, and salary insights.

Help HR teams make informed, proactive retention decisions.

### ✨ Key Features

📈 Interactive Power BI Dashboard – Visualizes trends, patterns, and KPIs related to employee attrition.

🧮 Predictive Modeling – Uses machine learning techniques to forecast employees likely to leave.

🧍‍♀️ Demographic Analysis – Attrition segmented by gender, age, department, and education level.

💼 Department-Level Insights – Compare attrition across HR, Sales, and R&D departments.

⚙️ Custom DAX Measures – Calculates attrition rate, satisfaction scores, and average income.

🔄 Automated Data Cleaning – Ensures data accuracy and consistency for better decision-making.

### 📊 Data Source

The dataset used in this project is based on a sample HR Employee Attrition dataset containing information such as:

Age, Gender, Education

Department, Job Role, Monthly Income

Job Satisfaction, Overtime, and Work Experience

Attrition status (“Yes” or “No”)

The data was cleaned and processed before visualization to ensure accuracy and integrity.
## 🧠 Methodology

### Data Collection & Cleaning

Imported HR dataset (CSV/Excel)

Removed duplicates, handled missing values, standardized column names

Converted categorical variables to numeric where required

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified correlations between attrition and features such as salary, overtime, and satisfaction

Visualized patterns using histograms, heatmaps, and bar charts

### Data Modeling & DAX Calculations

Created calculated columns and measures in Power BI for attrition rate, tenure, and salary bands

### Predictive Modeling (Optional Python Integration)

Applied Logistic Regression / Random Forest to predict probability of attrition

Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC score

### Dashboard Development

Built interactive visuals and KPIs in Power BI

Added slicers for department, gender, and job role filters

### 💡 Key Insights

🚪 Overall Attrition Rate: ~16%

💰 Income Effect: Employees with lower salaries and frequent overtime have higher attrition risk.

❤️ Job Satisfaction: Low satisfaction scores strongly correlate with turnover.

🧑‍💼 Department Impact: Sales shows the highest attrition rate, followed by HR.

🕒 Experience Factor: Employees with 2–5 years of experience are most likely to leave.

### 🏢 Business Impact

This project delivers tangible benefits to HR and leadership teams:

✅ Early identification of high-risk employees

✅ Data-backed retention and engagement strategies

✅ Reduction in hiring and onboarding costs

✅ Improved workforce stability and satisfaction

✅ Better resource planning and succession management
